%% Constructing Data Matrix X
%1. Construct data matrix X such that each rows are the vectorized image
% Stack both the cat and dogs data matrix together

X=double(X); %convert 

%2. Singular Value Decomposition of X


figure(3)
% 3. plot the normalized singular values of X and see correlation structure
% of our data matrix.
xlabel('Singular Values')
ylabel('% Variance')

%% 
%The PCs are in decreasing order of variance explained in the data

for j=1:4
    subplot(2,2,j) 
    
    
    colormap hot
    title(sprintf('PC %d',j))
    
end


%% How similar are cats and dogs?
%First project the data on the first three PCs
T = X'*u(:,1:3)

%Repeat this using other PCs, 
%Are the separation between the two groups better or worse?
